# Project A shop business hours website powered by Airtable 
Get data from your Airtable databases using the Airtable API
a simple website that gets opening hours from an Airtable API, and a nice UI.
Airtable allows to create a database “in the cloud” in a easy  way.
Why? non-coders updates/ opening hours, displayed in the website. (ex:Airtable on smartphone, site easily updated.) 
Node.js server to create a page server-side.
